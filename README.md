- The shell executes commands and all following arguments. No special information needed.
- The program splits the user input along each whitespace character and saves to an array. The first index is the command, and everything following is an argument.
- Incomplete:
  - Command history
  - Command shortcuts
  - Current directory display in prompt
  - Colored propt support
  - Error handling without program exit
